# PyBer_Analysis

## Purpose
### The purpose of this analysis was to gather the ride sharing data from different city types: Rural, Urban, and Suburban. The data we collected was the total weeky fare from each of these.

##Results
###Results as shown in the graph pictured show that Urban areas make the most profit of the three city types. This is followed by Suburban cities, and the very least profitable being the Rural cities. Through April we see a major spike in Suburban ride sharing profits, with a steadier rise in profits for the Urban cities. This is contrasted by a decline in Rural cities in the same month. ![PyBer_fare_summary](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112450151/204706036-5d679f27-01d5-403f-9769-fe3dd79cad1b.png)
We do see we have the most drivers in the Urban areas, therefore they charge less. We also notice Rural drivers charge more on average fare, which may curtail any increased usage.

#Reccomendations 
###I reccomend three courses of action
      1. Decrease the average fare rate in Rural cities to promote usage, or offering more coupons and deals
      2. Slight increase on fare rate in Rural cities to capitalize on the constant and high flow of revenue
      3. Increase rates on Suburban cities during peak months only.
